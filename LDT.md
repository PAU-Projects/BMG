Op-Code  Operand  Description  
1         RXY  LOAD the register R with the bit pattern f
ound in the memory cell whose address is XY.        
Example:
 14A3 would cause the contents of the memo
ry cell located at address A3 to be        
  placed in register 4.             
2         RXY  LOAD the register R with the bit pattern XY.                                                                               
Example:
 20A3 would cause the value A3 to be placed in register 0.                                          
3         RXY  STORE the bit pattern found in register R 
in the memory cell whose address is XY.                
Example:
 35B1 would cause the contents of register 
5 to be placed in the memory cell whose   
  address is B1.              
4         0RS    MOVE the bit pattern found in register R to register S.                                                                
Example:
 40A4 would cause the contents of register 
A to be copied into register 4.                  
5         RST   ADD the bit patterns in registers S and T 
as though they were twoâ€™s complement                     
  representations and leave the result in register R.         
Example:
 5726 would cause the binary values in regi
sters 2 and 6 to be added and the sum     
  placed in register 7.             
6         RST   ADD the bit patterns in registers S and T as 
though they represented values in floating-point   
                      notation and leave the floating-point result in register R.                                                              
Example:
 634E would cause the values in registers 4 a
nd E to be added as floating-point values   
  and the result to be placed in register 3.          
7         RST   OR the bit patterns in registers S and T and place the result in register R.                                  
Example:
 7CB4 would cause the result of ORing the contents of registers B and 4 to be placed   
  in register C.              
8         RST   AND the bit patterns in register S and T 
and place the result in register R.                                 
Example:
 8045 would cause the result of ANDing the contents of registers 4 and 5 to be placed   
  in register 0.              
9         RST   EXCLUSIVE OR the bit patterns in registers S and T and place the result in register R.          
Example:
 95F3 would cause the result of EXCLUSIVE OR
ing the contents of registers F and 3   
  to be placed in register 5.             
A        R0X   ROTATE the bit pattern in register R one bit 
to the right X times. Each time place the bit that   
                      started at the low-order end at the high-order end.                                                                         
Example:
 A403 would cause the contents of register 4 
to be rotated 3 bits to the right in a       
  circular fashion.              
B        RXY  JUMP to the instruction located in the memory 
cell at address XY if the bit pattern in register   
                      R is equal to the bit pattern in register num
ber 0. Otherwise, continue with the normal             
                      sequence of execution. (The ju
mp is implemented by copying 
XY into the program counter    
  during the execute phase.)            
Example:
 B43C would first compare the contents of regi
ster 4 with the contents of register 0.   
                      If the two were equal, the pattern 3C would be 
placed in the program counter so that the next   
                      instruction executed would be the one located 
at that memory address. Otherwise, nothing      
                      would be done and program execution would 
continue in its normal sequence.                          
C 000 HALT execution.              
Example:
 C000 would cause program execution to stop.
